## Code Breakers

This is a rails app that will generate cypher texts and then help people decrypt them with a ui driven replacement.

The user is presented with a cypher text, the type of cypher that was used and statistics about the cypher text. Then, they are able to try different combinations to find the key. For example, with a subsitution cypher they will be given the frequency of letters and then allowed to try different subsitutions.
